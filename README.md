# Data-Science-Projects
- Some projects to learn machine learning using R and varius machine learning Algorithms
- Technologies : Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Spring, Power BI
- Sentiment analysis of Kaggle Competition: The Rotten Tomatoes movie review data set is a corpus of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis. We used Python and Vowpal Wabbit to predict sentiments from movie reviews.
Vowpal Wabbit is notable as an efficient scalable implementation of online machine learning and support for a number of machine learning reductions, importance weighting, and a selection of different loss functions and optimization algorithms
- Hubway Visualization challenge using power BI
- UIC data sets to learn machine learning algorithms. Implemeted various algorithms such as Logistic, Regression, Neural Networks using R
